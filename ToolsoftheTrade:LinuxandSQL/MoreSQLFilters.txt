In this scenario, you’re investigating a recent security incident.

You need to gather information about login attempts for certain dates and times. This will help in resolving a security incident.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll retrieve login events made after a certain date. 
Second, you’ll narrow the focus of the search to filter logins in a date range. 
Third, you’ll investigate logins that were made at certain times. 
Finally, you’ll filter login attempts based on their event IDs.

1. Complete the SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts made after '2022-05-09'. 
- select * from log_in_attempts where login_date > '2022-05-09';
2. Complete the SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts that were made on or after '2022-05-09'.
- select * from log_in_attempts where login_date >= '2022-05-09';
3. Login attempts made between '2022-05-09' and '2022-05-11'.
- select * from log_in_attempts where login_date between '2022-05-09' and '2022-05-11';

4. Write a SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts made before '07:00:00'.
- select * from log_in_attempts where login_time < '07:00:00';
5. Modify the query to return logins between '06:00:00' and '07:00:00'.
- select * from log_in_attempts where login_time between '06:00:00' and '07:00:00';

6. Write a query to return login attempts with event_id greater than or equal to 100.
- select * from log_in_attempts where event_id>=100;

7. Modify the query to return only login attempts with event_id between 100 and 150.
- select * from log_in_attempts where event_id between 100 and 150;
