In this scenario, a new employee with the username researcher9 joins an organization. You have to add them to the system and continue to manage their access during their time with the organization.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll add a new employee to the system and then to their primary group. 
Second, you’ll make this employee the owner of a file related to a particular project. 
Third, you’ll add the new employee to a supplementary group. 
Finally, you’ll delete the employee from the system.

1. Write a command to add a user called researcher9 to the system.
- sudo useradd researcher9
2. Next, you need to add the new user to the research_team group.
- sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9
3. The new employee, researcher9, will take responsibility for project_r. In this task, you must make them the owner of the project_r.txt file.
The project_r.txt file is located in the /home/researcher2/projects directory, and owned by the researcher2 user.

Use the chown command to make researcher9 the owner of /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt.

- sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt

4. In this task, you must add researcher9 to a secondary group (sales_team). Their primary group is still research_team.

Use the usermod command with the -a and -G options to add researcher9 to the sales_team group as a secondary group.

- sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9 

5. Run a command to delete researcher9 from the system:
- sudo userdel researcher9 
Output: Userdel: Group researcher9 not removed because it is not the primary group of user researcher9.  

- sudo groupdel researcher9 
Note: When you create a new user in Linux, a group with the same name as the user is automatically created and the user is the only member of that group. After removing users, it is good practice to clean up any such empty groups that may remain behind.
