In this scenario, you need to obtain information contained in server log and user data files. You also need to find files with specific names.

Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll navigate to the logs directory and return the error messages in the server_logs.txt file. 
Next, you’ll navigate to the users directory and search for files that contain a specific string in their names. 
Finally, you’ll search for information contained in user files.grep error server_logs.txt

1. Navigate to the /home/analyst/logs directory.
- cd /home/analyst/logs
2. Use grep to filter the server_logs.txt file, and return all lines containing the text string error.
- grep error server_logs.txt

3. Navigate to the /home/analyst/reports/users directory. Using the pipe character (|), pipe the output of the ls command to the grep command to list only the files containing the string Q1 in their names.
- ls /home/analyst/reports/users | grep Q1

4. List the files that contain the word access in their names.
- ls /home/analyst/reports/users | grep access

5. Display the files in the /home/analyst/reports/users directory.
- cd /home/analyst/reports/users
6. Search the Q2_deleted_users.txt file for the username jhill.
- grep jhill Q2_deleted_users.txt

7. Search the Q4_added_users.txt file to list the users who were added to the Human Resources department.
- grep Human Resourses Q4_added_users.txt
