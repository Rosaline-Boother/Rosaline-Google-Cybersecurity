In this scenario, you’ll investigate a recent security incident that compromised some machines.

You are responsible for getting the required information from the database for the investigation.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll use an inner join to identify which employees are using which machines. 
Second, you’ll use left and right joins to find machines that do not belong to any specific user and users who do not have any specific machine assigned to them. 
Finally, you’ll use an inner join to list all login attempts made by all employees.
1. Retrieve all records from the machines table. 
- select * from machines; 

2. Complete the query to perform an inner join between the machines and employees tables on the device_id column. 
- select * from machines inner join employees on employees.device_id=machines.device_id;

3. Run the following SQL query to connect the machines and employees tables through a left join. 
- select * from machines left join employees on employees.device_id=machines.device_id;

4. Run the following SQL query to connect the machines and employees tables through a right join.
- select * from machines right join employees on employees.device_id=machines.device_id;

5. Run the following SQL query to perform an inner join on the employees and log_in_attempts tables. 
- select * from employees inner join log_in_attempts on employees.username=log_in_attempts.username;
