In this scenario, you have to find more information about commands that you need to use. You also need to discover which command to use to perform a certain task.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll explore a few commands you can use in the shell to learn more about other commands. 
Next, you’ll find an option you need to add to a command. 
Third, you’ll use a command to get a brief description of commands so you can identify their differences. 
Finally, you’ll identify the command you need to perform a task.

1. First, imagine you can’t quite remember what the cat command does and want a quick reminder.
- whatis cat 
2. Next, imagine that you want more details about cat and all of its options.
- man cat
3. Use apropos to find a command that returns the first part of a file:
- apropos -a first part file
4. Use the most appropriate Linux command to get help on the useradd command and learn more about all of its options.
- man useradd
