In this scenario, you have to determine which employee devices must be updated. You also need to investigate user login activity to explore if any unusual activity has occurred.

The information you need is located in the machines and login_attempts tables in the organization database.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll obtain information on the employee devices that must be updated. 
Next, you’ll examine the login attempts for unusual activity. 
Finally, you’ll use the ORDER BY keyword to sort the data returned by your SQL queries.
In this task, you need to obtain information on employee devices because your team needs to update them. The information you need is in the machines table in the organization database.

1. First, you need to retrieve all the information about the employee devices.
- select * from machines; 
2. Select only the device_id and email_client columns from the machines table. 
- select device_id, email_client from machines; 
3. Complete the query to return only the device_id, operating_system, and OS_patch_date columns from the machines table. 
- select device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date from machines; 

4. Write a SQL query to select the event_id and country columns from the log_in_attempts table.
- Select event_id, country from log_in_attempts;
5. Write a SQL query that selects the username, login_date, and login_time columns from the log_in_attempts table.
- select username, login_date, login_time from log_in_attempts;
6. Write a SQL query that selects all columns from the log_in_attempts table, using a single symbol after the SELECT keyword.
- select * from log_in_attempts;

7. Order the log_in_attempts data by login_date
- select * from log_in_attempts order by login_date;

8. Modify the query from the previous step by adding the login time to the ORDER BY clause. 
- select * from log_in_attempts order by login_date, login_time;
