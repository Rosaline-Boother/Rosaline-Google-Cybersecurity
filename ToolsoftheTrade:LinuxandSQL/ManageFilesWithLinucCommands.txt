In this scenario, you need to ensure that the /home/analyst directory is properly organized.

You have to make a few changes to the /home/analyst directory and the files it contains.

You also have to edit a file to record the changes or updates you make to the directory.
Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll create a new subdirectory called logs in the /home/analyst directory. 
Next, you’ll remove the temp subdirectory. Then, you’ll move the Q3patches.txt file to the reports subdirectory and delete the tempnotes.txt file. 
Finally, you’ll create a new .txt file called tasks in the notes subdirectory and add a note to the file describing the tasks you've performed.

1. Create a new subdirectory called logs in the /home/analyst directory.
- cd /home/analyst
- mkdir logs
2. List the contents of the /home/analyst directory to confirm that you’ve successfully created the new logs subdirectory.
- ls
3. Remove the /home/analyst/temp directory.
- rmdir temp
4. List the contents of the /home/analyst directory to confirm that you have removed the temp subdirectory.
- ls
5. Navigate to the /home/analyst/notes directory.
- cd notes
6. Move the Q3patches.txt file from the /home/analyst/notes directory to the /home/analyst/reports directory.
- mv Q3patches.txt /home/analyst/reports
7. List the contents of the /home/analyst/reports directory to confirm that you have moved the file successfully.
- ls /home/analyst/reports

8. Remove the tempnotes.txt file from the /home/analyst/notes directory.
- rm tempnotes.txt
9. List the contents of the /home/analyst/notes directory to confirm that you’ve removed the file successfully.
- ls

10. Use the touch command to create an empty file called tasks.txt in the /home/analyst/notes directory.
- touch tasks.txt
11. List the contents of the /home/analyst/notes directory to confirm that you have created a new file.
- ls

12. Using the nano text editor, open the tasks.txt file that is located in the /home/analyst/notes directory.
- nano tasks.txt 

13. Copy and paste the following text into the text input area of the nano editor:
  Completed tasks
  1. Managed file structure in /home/analyst

13. Press CTRL+X to exit the nano text editor.
This triggers a prompt asking Save modified bufferer?

Press Y to confirm that you want to save the new data to your file. (Answering "no" will discard changes.)

Press ENTER to confirm that File Name to Write is tasks.txt.

14. Clear the Bash shell window and remove any traces of the nano text input area.
- clear

15. Display the contents of the tasks.txt file to confirm that it contains the updated task details.
- cat tasks.txt
