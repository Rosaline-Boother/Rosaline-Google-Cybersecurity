In this scenario, you’re a security analyst investigating traffic to a website.
Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll open the packet capture file and explore the basic Wireshark graphic user interface. 
Second, you’ll open a detailed view of a single packet and explore how to examine the various protocol and data layers inside a network packet. 
Third, you’ll apply filters to select and inspect packets based on specific criteria. 
Fourth, you’ll filter and inspect UDP DNS traffic to examine protocol data. 
Finally, you’ll apply filters to TCP packet data to search for specific payload text data.

1. Double-click the sample file on the Windows desktop. This will start Wireshark.
A lot of network packet traffic is listed, packet lists a group of light blue packets that all contain DNS traffic, followed by green packets that contain a mixture of TCP and HTTP protocol traffic.

2. Filter for traffic associated with a specific IP address.
- ip.addr == 142.250.1.139

3. Double-click the first packet that lists TCP as the protocol.
This opens a packet details pane window.

4. Filter to select traffic for a specific source IP address only.
- ip.src == 142.250.1.139

5. Filter to select traffic for a specific destination IP address only.
- ip.dst == 142.250.1.139

6. Filter to select traffic to or from a specific Ethernet MAC address.
- eth.addr == 42:01:ac:15:e0:02

7.  Filter to select UDP port 53 traffic. 
- udp.port == 53

8. Filter to select TCP port 80 traffic.
- tcp.port == 80

9. Filter to select TCP packet data that contains specific text data.
- tcp contains "curl"
Output: This filters to packets containing web requests made with the curl command in this sample packet capture file.
