You’re a network analyst who needs to use tcpdump to capture and analyze live network traffic from a Linux virtual machine.
Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll identify network interfaces to capture network packet data. 
Second, you’ll use tcpdump to filter live network traffic. 
Third, you’ll capture network traffic using tcpdump. Finally, you’ll filter the captured packet data.

1. Identify the interfaces that are available
- sudo ifconfig  (The Ethernet network interface is identified by the entry with the eth prefix.)

2. Iidentify the interface options available for packet capture
- sudo tcpdump -D

3. Filter live network packet data from the eth0 interface with tcpdump
- sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5
        -i eth0: Capture data specifically from the eth0 interface.
        -v: Display detailed packet data.
        -c5: Capture 5 packets of data.

4. Capture packet data into a file called capture.pcap
- sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap & 
        -i eth0: Capture data from the eth0 interface.
        -nn: Do not attempt to resolve IP addresses or ports to names.This is best practice from a security perspective, as the lookup data may not be valid. It also prevents malicious actors from being alerted to an investigation.
        -c9: Capture 9 packets of data and then exit.
        port 80: Filter only port 80 traffic. This is the default HTTP port.
        -w capture.pcap: Save the captured data to the named file.
        &: This is an instruction to the Bash shell to run the command in the background.

5. Use curl to generate some HTTP (port 80) traffic
curl opensource.google.com

When the curl command is used like this to open a website, it generates some HTTP (TCP port 80) traffic that can be captured.

6. Verify that packet data has been captured:
- ls -l capture.pcap
Note: The "Done" in the output indicates that the packet was captured.

7. Use the tcpdump command to filter the packet header data from the capture.pcap capture file.
- sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v
        -nn: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
        -r: Read capture data from the named file.
        -v: Display detailed packet data.
8. Use the tcpdump command to filter the extended packet data from the capture.pcap capture file.
- sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X
        -nn: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
        -r: Read capture data from the named file.
        -X: Display the hexadecimal and ASCII output format packet data. Security analysts can analyze hexadecimal and ASCII output to detect patterns or anomalies during malware analysis or forensic analysis.
