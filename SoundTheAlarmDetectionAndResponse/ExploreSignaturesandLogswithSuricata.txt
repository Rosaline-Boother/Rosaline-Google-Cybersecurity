In this scenario, you’re a security analyst who must monitor traffic on your employer's network. You’ll be required to configure Suricata and use it to trigger alerts.

Here’s how you'll do this task: First, you'll explore custom rules in Suricata. 
Second, you'll run Suricata with a custom rule in order to trigger it, and examine the output logs in the fast.log file. 
Finally, you’ll examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the standard eve.json log file.

1.  Display the rule in the custom.rules file
- cat custom.rules

Output: alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"GET on wire"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)

2. List the files in the /var/log/suricata folder:
- ls -l /var/log/suricata
Note that before running Suricata, there are no files in the /var/log/suricata directory. 

3. Run suricata using the custom.rules and sample.pcap files:
- sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none

4. List the files in the /var/log/suricata folder:
- ls -l /var/log/suricata
Note that after running Suricata, there are now four files in the /var/log/suricata directory, including the fast.log and eve.json files. You'll examine these files in more detail.

5. Use the cat command to display the fast.log file generated by Suricata:
- cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log

Each line or entry in the fast.log file corresponds to an alert generated by Suricata when it processes a packet that meets the conditions of an alert generating rule.

6. Use the cat command to display the entries in the eve.json file:
- cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json
The output returns the raw content of the file. You'll notice that there is a lot of data returned that is not easy to understand in this format.

7. Use the jq command to display the entries in an improved format:
- jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less

8. Use the jq command to extract specific event data from the eve.json file:
jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json

9. Use the jq command to display all event logs related to a specific flow_id from the eve.json file. T
he flow_id value is a 16-digit number and will vary for each of the log entries. 

- jq "select(.flow_id==489697480709364)" /var/log/suricata/eve.json
