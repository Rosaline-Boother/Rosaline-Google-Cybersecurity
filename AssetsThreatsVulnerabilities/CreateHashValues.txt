In this scenario, we need to investigate whether two files are identical or different.

Here’s how you'll do this task: First, you’ll display the contents of two files and create hashes for each file. 
Next, you’ll examine the hashes and compare them.

1. List the contents of the directory.
- ls
Two files, file1.txt and file2.txt, are listed.

2. Display the contents of the file1.txt file.
- cat file1.txt
Output: O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

3. Display the contents of the file2.txt file.
- cat file2.txt
Output: X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

4. Generate the hash of the file1.txt file.
- sha256sum file1.txt 
Output: 131f95c51cc819465fa1797f6ccacf9d494aaaff46fa3eac73ae63ffbdfd8267  file1.txt

5. Generate the hash of the file2.txt file.
- sha256sum file2.txt 
Output: 2558ba9a4cad1e69804ce03aa2a029526179a91a5e38cb723320e83af9ca017b  file2.txt

6. Generate the hash of the file1.txt file, and send the output to a new file called file1hash
- sha256sum file1.txt >> file1hash

7. Generate the hash of the file2.txt file, and send the output to a new file called file2hash.
- sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash

8. Display the hash values in the file1hash and file2hash files.
Inspect the output and note the difference in the hash values.
- cat file1hash
- cat file2hash

Note: Although the content in file1.txt and file2.txt previously appeared identical, the hashes written to the file1hash and file2hash files are completely different.

9. Highlight the differences in the file1hash and file2hash files.
- cmp file1hash file2hash

Note: The output of the cmp command indicates that the hashes differ at the first character in the first line.
